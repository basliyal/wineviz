    <h1> Wine Rating & Pricing</h1>
  </div>
  <div id = "introduction">
    <p>A wine rating system is a numeric value on a scale of 100 points provided to
      a wine by set of critics. The method is considered <br>flawed by many since it
      doesn't hold any scientific measuement and dependent of individual critics
      choices and their taste prefernces. <br>However, The 100 point system is unified worldwide
      used and has become a goto method for people to decide on wine tasting <br>and buying. </p>

      <p> This visualization will help us understand how the Wine rating system works for
        different wines and how different region <br>fairs in the rating system. </p>

        <p>The 100 points scale actually starts at 50 and describe each range as below: </p>

        <ul class="list" style="margin-left:20px;">
          <li><strong>under-79</strong> wines are flawed and taste average</li>
          <li><strong>80-84</strong> wines are ‘above average’ to ‘good’</li>
          <li><strong>85-90</strong> wines are ‘good’ to ‘very good’ </li>
          <li><strong>90-94</strong> wines are ‘superior’ to ‘exceptional’ </li>
          <li><strong>95-100</strong> wines are benchmark examples or ‘classic’ </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
      </div>

    in Above graphs we can see while Wine Quality follows a normal distribution wine prices graphs decline
    sharply towards higher price. This indicates while <b>most wines are avg in quality </b> and have
       equal distribution for higher and lower quality of wines.
       Whereas, price-wise <b> most wines are cheaper <b> and we find low number of wines in higher price range.


    in Next slides, we will focus on global quality distribution and wine price distributions.
